          10 Things You Didn’t Know About Albert Einstein:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the
            internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is
            simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math
            was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His
            involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he
            helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a
            letter to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a
            weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated
            pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced
            that America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work
            out, Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played piano
            so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin lessons—at
            the young age of five.
          </li>
          <li>
            He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first
            president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the position,
            but he declined.
          </li>
          <li>
            He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife,
            Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was,
            actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later
            years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire
            family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a
            servant than a wife.
          </li>
          <li>
            He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t
            particularly surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he
            didn’t receive it for the general or special theory of relativity,
            but rather for the photoelectric effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby.
            But by his own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor.
            In fact, he didn’t even know how to swim.
          </li>
          <li>
            His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did
            his autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually got the
            permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired from
            Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for
            over forty years before finally returning it in 1998.
